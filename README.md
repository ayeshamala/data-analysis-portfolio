# Ayesha Idris Mala - Data Analytics Portfolio

## About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Ayesha, and I have a strong technical foundation with a Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications Engineering. After earning my bachelor's, I realized that I enjoyed crafting narratives and engaging with audiences as much as I thrived in problem-solving and analytical thinking. This led me to pursue a career in content production, where I could channel my creativity and technical understanding into writing, editing, and producing compelling content.

As my career in content production progressed, I got interested in how data could be used to tell stories and drive decision-making. This sparked my transition into **data analytics**, where I found the perfect intersection between my technical skills and my passion for uncovering meaningful insights from data.

Currently, I am focused on expanding my expertise in data analysis using tools like **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**. I work with complex datasets to extract insights, solve business problems, and communicate data-driven stories. 

I have created this repository to showcase my analytics skills and keep track of my data analytics projects.
